// Create a Principal class.

// It should inherit from Person, and have the following additional attributes and methods:

// teachers - an array of Teacher objects
// hireTeacher - a method that receives a teacher and adds it to the teachers array
    // It should also console log "<principal name> just hired <teacher name>"
// students an array of Student objects
// recruitStudent - a method that receives a student and adds it to the students array
// expelStudent - a method that receives a student and removes it from the studentsarray (for now, you can just search by name)
// transferStudent - a method that receives a student and a principal, removes the student from students and pushes it to the other principal's students array
